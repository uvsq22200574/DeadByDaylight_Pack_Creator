# DBD Pack Creator

* I created this project to maintain my own pack but didnâ€™t know a direct way to do it while keeping up with updates. I used to spend a lot of time doing it manually, but with this tool I can generate **~2000 images in mere seconds**.
* It's a tool to maintain a JSON database of layers and automatically apply backgrounds or other modifications to icons. The repository also includes a script to create the database (Python file).

* For detailed usage instructions, see the [Wiki](https://github.com/uvsq22200574/DeadByDaylight_Pack_Creator/wiki).
* For official and up to date data, see the <a href="https://deadbydaylight.wiki.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dead By Daylight Wiki</a>.
