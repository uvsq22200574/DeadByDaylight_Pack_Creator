# DBD Pack Creator

* I created this project to maintain my own pack but didn’t know a direct way to do it while keeping up with updates. I used to spend a lot of time doing it manually, but with this tool I can generate **~2000 images in mere seconds**.
* It's a tool to maintain a JSON database of layers and automatically apply backgrounds or other modifications to icons. The repository also includes a script to create the database (Python file).

* For detailed usage instructions, see the [Wiki](https://github.com/uvsq22200574/DeadByDaylight_Pack_Creator/wiki).

* **You will need to provide the base Dead by Daylight assets or those you own yourself. The default assets can be obtained from [Nighlight](https://nightlight.gg/packs/default).  
I am not affiliated with Nighlight or Dead by Daylight, and no copyrighted assets are included in this repository.**
